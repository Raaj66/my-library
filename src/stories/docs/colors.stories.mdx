# Colors

## Primary
Primary colors are the color displayed most frequently across all products.

## Gray
The gray palette have varying degrees of saturation that allow for the appropriate level of warmth across marketing and product. Typically they are used for text and subtle backgrounds when we don't want to draw too much attention to a particular touchpoint or convey information such as "to do" or "disabled". 

## Accents
A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish a design. Having a secondary color is optional, and should be applied sparingly to accent select parts of your UI. 

## ICN Table
Used in various areas throughout the platform, mostly used in Tables to provide a slight color variation.

## Transparency
Transparency allows you to design with various shades of a color. For all of iCapitalâ€™s Primary, Secondary, and Grays, you may use a transparent swatch to distinguish between light and dark.
